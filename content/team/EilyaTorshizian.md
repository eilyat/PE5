Projects
-	Economic contribution studies 
I frequently lead teams that estimate specific sectors’ contribution to the New Zealand economy, or regions within it. Using NZIER’s Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) models, these projects look at how growth in one sector flows through the economy, generating additional jobs, wages and exports. Such reports have been written for the professional services, dairy, kiwifruit, red meat, and other industries. 

-	Shaping future of Dunedin Transport. New Zealand Transport Agency (NZTA), 2020
I led the economic assessment of a major transport project in Dunedin. The estimation of wellbeing outcomes for the Dunedin communities of different interventions is combined with stakeholder engagement. This ensures the consistency of the policy target with how the community defines the desired outcomes.

-	Empirical Wellbeing Approach to Total Impact Reporting for Tāmaki Regeneration Programme, 2019
I supervised and developed a total impact reporting tool capturing the fiscal, economic and well-being outcomes of regional investments in Tāmaki. The tool is consistent with Treasury’s Wellbeing approach and provides estimates of non-monetised values of regional investments.

-	Ashburton labour Force Plan: Assessing Ashburton’s labour force and addressing its labour shortages
I supervised and developed measures of Quality of Life and Quality of Business in New Zealand. Using this innovative approach, we estimated the shortage of labour compared to an unobserved status of the economy, asking what if Ashburton would have reached its potential quality of life and qualify of business? See the report here.

-	Trade liberalisation, FTAs and regional economic integration  
I have written numerous reports looking at how trade liberalisation, free trade agreements (FTAs) and regional integration initiatives deliver economic benefits and present difficult trade-offs. For these studies I used innovative frontier econometric approaches and the GTAP CGE model. These reports have informed domestic and international trade negotiators as they consider the optimal approach to pursuing regional trade liberalisation; and helped inform the public and firms about opportunities and risks.  

-	The economic impact of a large-scale regional investment, 2019
I managed this study of a (relatively) large-scale regional investment. The study used our Regional Computational General Equilibrium models to understand the interactions between different economic sectors (across industries, between households and industries, at regional and national levels).

-	Impacts of Socio-Demographic Changes on the New Zealand Land Transport System, 2018
The study investigates the impact of socioeconomic factors on demand for personal land travel and private vehicle using NZIER’s Regional Land Transport Demand model. See the report here.

-	The impact of drinking during pregnancy on children behavioural outcomes
I provided analytical inputs to this study and developed the modelling framework using Growing Up in New Zealand (GUINZ) data.

-	Impacts of Upgrades of the Lower North Island road transport, 2017 
The study investigated the impact of upgrades in the road transport on the socioeconomic outcomes for different industries located in areas as granular as area unit levels. 

-	Effects of Crowding, Density and Deprivation on Residential Satisfaction, 2017 
This study investigates the impact of factors of living on the wellbeing outcomes for Aucklanders. This is the first economic study using a wide range of factors of living to explain a non-price outcome. See the study here.

-	A Computational General Equilibrium Model (CGE) Approach to Urban Freshwater Planning, 2016
I recommended, raised funds and supervised this study providing a robust framework for understanding the trade-offs between urban development and environmental outcomes. See the study here.

Research contributions
-	Contribution of my PhD thesis:
o	The first study, internationally, that: aims at residents’ satisfaction with their residential environment rather than at prices; accounts for the role of relative positions of households and households’ expectations on their understanding of their living environment; empirically assesses the causal impact of the factors of space, such as density, on household’s residential satisfaction. 
o	The first study, in New Zealand: assessing the impact of intensification on Aucklanders’ residential satisfaction; Merging individual level data with neighbourhood characteristics and geospatial datasets; introducing the best definition for neighbourhood boundaries and introducing exogenous of neighbourhood segregation in Auckland.

This is the first study of costs of NTMs at HS6 product level distinguishing between general and specific cost of NTMs. The study uses an extra big data of bilateral trade, but the number of available observations is extremely small and the range of factors that we need to account for is very wide. We have applied innovative econometric techniques for overcoming the challenges.

Following the ‘5 by 2030’ affordability target, I highlighted the need for further investigation and undertook a very detailed analysis of affordability issue by accounting for a wide range of factors. Accordingly, we realised that aiming at the median affordability for Auckland is misleading.

This study investigates the permissibility of the council’s activity statuses and its impact on regional development. The results of the study shows that, opposed to our common belief, a restricted discretionary activity is less permissive than a discretionary activity. This paper presented to ELT and got a lot of attention, especially amongst the IHP.

This is a study of the impact of locating next to a rich area on residential satisfaction of the residents of the relatively poor area. The results, which have been frequently used in different pieces of advice (provided to different stakeholders), are very useful for the policy in order to provide enduring neighbourhoods in Auckland.

This is a causal study of the impact of intensification on Aucklander’s satisfaction with their residential environment. The study provides the most relevant definition for neighbourhood boundaries for Aucklanders. Since intensification is one of the main instruments of the council, the results of this paper are very useful for the council’s planning regulations.
