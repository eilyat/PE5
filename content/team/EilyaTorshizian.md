This is the first study of costs of NTMs at HS6 product level distinguishing between general and specific cost of NTMs. The study uses an extra big data of bilateral trade, but the number of available observations is extremely small and the range of factors that we need to account for is very wide. We have applied innovative econometric techniques for overcoming the challenges.

This study investigates the permissibility of the council’s activity statuses and its impact on regional development.

This is a causal study of the impact of intensification on Aucklander’s satisfaction with their residential environment.
