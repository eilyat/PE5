Our **Energy, Environment and Economy NZ (E3-NZ)** model provides a realistic replication of real-world behaviour of individuals and industries and allows for the possibility of fundamental uncertainty. People and businesses know that there are “unknown unknowns” in the economy and may choose to plan accordingly

**E3-NZ** is the most comprehensive economic model of the New Zealand (NZ) regions’ economies. Developed in partnership with Cambridge Econometrics (University of Cambridge). Principal Economics is the only provider of a marcoeconometric model of the NZ economy.

The transition to a low-carbon economy depends on the adoption of new technologies. It is therefore crucial that any modelling of the transition includes a realistic treatment of technology diffusion. The power, road transport, and steel sectors in **E3-NZ** are represented using a novel framework for the dynamic selection and diffusion of innovations

The E3 model is designed to address national and global economic and economy-environment policy challenges but can be applied to other policy areas due to its in-built adaptability. The model has been used in policy areas as diverse as climate change, gender equality and Brexit. Internationally, there has been an increase in the use of marcoeconometric models. Frequent users of E3 models include:

  •   European climate foundation  
  •   WWF (World Wild Fund)  
  •   World resources institute  
  •   European Commission  
  •   International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA)
