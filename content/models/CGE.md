Our **Computational General Equilibrium (CGE)** model captures all economic interactions in the New Zealand economy, including trade and spending between firms on one anotherâ€™s goods and inputs; spending by consumers on goods; investment decisions; and dynamics in the market such as demand for factors such as capital and labour, trade, employment and wage effects.

CGE models are a class of economic models that estimate how an economy might react to changes in policy, technology or other external factors. We are able to analyse large, discrete, policy changes that far from the status quo, building a bridge between economists and policy makers, and providing evidence for decision makers.
