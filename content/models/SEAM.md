Our **Sub-regional Economic Activity Model (SEAM)** provides details on the socioeconomic features of households, their choice of location and the economic activities of New Zealand industries. Our stochastic microsimulation framework accounts for the inflows and outflows of population are affected by both factors of **Quality of life (QL)** and **Quality of Business (QB)**.  

**Quality of Life** is affected by proximity to amenities and facilities, the endowments of an area (such as proximity to coastlines and greenspace and the hours of sunshine), and the cost of living. Increase in housing supply will change the cost of housing and that will affect the choice of location of households across Auckland suburbs.

**Quality of Business** leads to relocation of households with specific demographic features. For example, an observed international pattern is the increases in the size of the services sector. The activities associated with the services sector relocate to an area and that will lead to a change in the pattern of population growth.

The main advantage of **SEAM** is providing a broader tool for the assessment of economic activities and potential scenarios you want to investigate. The outputs of the model include:

  •   Population forecasts by residents in private occupied dwellings and non-private dwellings.  
  •   Household forecasts by composition (SNZ definition, 6 groups) for occupied private dwellings.  
  •   Dwelling forecasts by occupied private dwellings and vacant dwellings by dwelling type (SNZ definition, 3 groups).  
  •   Population forecasts by residents in private occupied dwellings by gender and age structure (5-year age groups).  


*In addition to the baseline model, we provide a range of scenario modelling for you can choose from including the impacts of COVID-19. SEAM provides forecasts of economic activity (output and employment) with outputs for 14 economic sectors, including the business categories, namely industrial, retail, office and other commercial, for the next 30 years, at the regional, territorial authority and area unit levels.*
