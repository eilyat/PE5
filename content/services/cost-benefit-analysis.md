Making decisions in uncertain times needs precise understanding of the costs and benefits. We can assist by identifying fiscal, economic and wellbeing benefits from your investment decision or policy intervention.

The team at Principal Economics have the experience and credibility to undertake cost-benefit analysis for government and businesses on a wide range of issues. We have extensive experience developing tools and frameworks for Cost Benefit Analysis. Principal Economics has assisted with cost benefit analysis of topical issues, such as the housing impacts of the recent proposed Resource Management system reforms.

Traditional CBA does not account for the distributional impacts of the initiatives. The identification and measurement of the trade-offs associated with interventions and the socioeconomic features of winners and losers of interventions provide useful information for decision makers. We use our expertise to ensure that decision makers are aware of the trade-offs from implementing different strategies.
