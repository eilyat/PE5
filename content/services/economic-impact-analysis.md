We provide independent  economic impact analysis to evaluate the impacts of a project, program or policy on regions, demographic groups, industry or the wider economy. Our team are experienced in communicating complicated economic issues to audiences with different backgrounds and familiar with political sensitivity of regional investments.

To provide a comprehensive understanding of the impact economic activities, we provide a robust methodology that captures the impact on all sectors of the economy and across all regions. The Principal Economicsâ€™ Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) and macroeconometric models of the New Zealand and regional economies capture the economy wide impacts of policies and investments. Our models provide the highest level of industrial and geographical disaggregation available in New Zealand.
