We provide expert advice on energy. Principal economics are experts in the field of energy economics with experience in developing and adopting economic models assessing energy issues in New Zealand. 

We provide you a robust evidence-based framework for addressing energy related issues using the Principal Economicsâ€™ Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model of the New Zealand and regional economies. 

Our econometrics and simulation models also provide a robust forecast tool for energy and electricity demand and prices. Our recent projects include providing forecasts for peak and off-peak electricity demand to our clients.
