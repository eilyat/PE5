Our population and demographic model provides decision support for the development of long term plans. The outputs of our models provide granular geographic level information useful for transport and urban planning, and the development of asset management and infrastructure investment plans.

For population and employment forecasting we have developed a Sub-regional Economic Activity Model (SEAM), which provides robust long-term forecasts for a range of the features of households and businesses.
