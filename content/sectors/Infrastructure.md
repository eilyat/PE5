We assist our clients in identifying the benefits of primary and secondary impact of infrastructure investments

Productivity gains from timely investments lead to profitability of industries, which lead to higher wages, and higher demand in the economy, and increases in GDP and eventually higher intergenerational wellbeing for New Zealand communities. The impact of timely infrastructure investment on labour productivity may have been even more significant following the Covid-19 pandemic.

We provide the most comprehensive evidence-based framework for estimating the economic outcomes of infrastructure investment using the Principal Economicsâ€™ Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model of the New Zealand and regional economies. Our model captures the widest possible range of impacts, by providing the highest level of industrial and geographical disaggregation available in New Zealand - incorporating 151 industries/ commodities, as well as specific modelling of household, government and export sectors across New Zealand.

Our analysis captures all the interactions across industries, households and regions and measures the final GDP and wellbeing gain through different channels.
