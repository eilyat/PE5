We assist with assessments of the impact of COVID-19 on demand for a range of services.
Given the high level of uncertainty over how the outbreak evolves we provide guidance on how COVID-19 may affect your market given a range of potential scenarios. 

#### Recent work:

We assisted with Chorus' submission to Commerce Commission to account for the impact of COVID-19 on the forecasts for the cost escalation series. 

We use simulation methods, to estimate the likely impacts to capture the impacts of COVID-19 to provide estimates for our clients until published data is fully able capture the impact of the COVID-19.
