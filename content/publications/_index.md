There is a need for better measurement of the outcomes of activities. The typical question is what measure to use to capture the progress in an intestment and the impact of that investment on the communities. Our paper provides a robust practical solution for finding the measures that best capture policy maker’s intended outcome and by accounting for communities’ perception of the outcomes – which leads to inclusive growth.

Abstract
 
Analysts may have multiple measures of household crowding, and so need to know which measure to emphasise. We analyse the relationships between alternative subjective and objective crowding measures and assess how well these alternative measures predict a measure of residential satisfaction. Statistically, a perceived crowding (PC) measure outperforms the people per bedroom (PPBR) measure, an objective measure of crowding. However, there may be bias in the relationship between PC and the residential satisfaction variable. Amongst objective measures, the Canadian National Occupancy Standard also outperforms PPBR. Nevertheless, all three measures are highly correlated and each helps to predict levels of residential satisfaction. Thus, any of the three measures provides a valid indicator of household crowding when assessing housing stress.</p>
