      <description>Our Energy, Environment and Economy NZ (E3-NZ) model provides a realistic replication of real-world behaviour of individuals and industries and allows for the possibility of fundamental uncertainty. People and businesses know that there are “unknown unknowns” in the economy and may choose to plan accordingly
E3-NZ is the most comprehensive economic model of the New Zealand (NZ) regions’ economies. Developed in partnership with Cambridge Econometrics (University of Cambridge). Principal Economics is the only provider of a macroeconometric model of the NZ economy.</description>

      <description>To estimate the impact of policies on different household income groups, we offer our Housing Affordability Simulation Model (ASIM). In ASIM, each household has an affordability limit based on their income levels, household size, wealth, mortgage rates, and the deposit ratio. Accordingly, the stock of housing (as determined based on the supply and demand analyses) will be allocated to the households at the highest price that they can afford to pay in an auction.</description>
